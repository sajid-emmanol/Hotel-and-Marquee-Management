# Hotel and Marquee Management
 The final year project, titled "Online Hotel and Marquee Management System," is a web-based application designed to streamline the booking and management of marquee and hotel facilities. The system enables users to browse available venues, check their specifications, and make reservations online, significantly reducing the time and manual effort involved in managing events. Key features include real-time booking availability, event customization, vendor management, and payment processing. The application aims to improve user convenience and operational efficiency for both customers and venue managers.
